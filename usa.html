                    <h2>FILM CENSORSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES</h2>
                    <p>Media in the U.S. isn't directly controlled. However, throughout the country's history in the medium of film, imperatives/organizations have existed in order to attempt to direct speech away from specific topics.</p> 
                    <br><p>Initially in Hollywood, the filmmaking center of the U.S., a set of rules named the Hays Production Code existed to attempt to regulate the kind of content made in films and, more importantly, whether films would receive exhibition as a result. Being used by the industry from the 30s to the mid-60s, the censorship wasn't be carried out on a governmental level but rather from within studios. As the studio system dissipated, however, so did the Production Code. However, state governments were still looking for ways to at least categorize what content was coming out and who should see it. As a result of this growing pressure, the industry created the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) in 1968, an organization that issued ratings to films to help parents determine whether films were objectionable to show to their children.</p>
                    <br><p>Although the intent was to inform parents, the rating system would inevitably become another form of self-censorship from the major studios. The first ratings that existed were G, M, R, and X. This would shift to G, GP, R, and X, which would then ultimately change into G, PG, R, and X. The PG-13 rating would be added in 1984 in between PG and R, and X would be replaced with NC-17 in 1990. In terms of censorship, having an NC-17 rating would effectively cripple films from getting wide releases. Studios would desperately avoid NC-17 ratings as much as possible, meaning directors would get the feared rating would be compelled to cut content and appeal their films in order to get to an R rating or lower. Once again, although not direct censorship or governmental censorship, market-based forces would often determine choices directors and editors would make on what they could keep in their films. </p>
